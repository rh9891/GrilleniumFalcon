## Installation

The application requires the following dependencies and/or package managers:
~~~
$ npm install body-parser
~~~

~~~
$ npm install express
~~~

The following dependency - though optional - can also be used as it automatically restarts the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. Saving it as a `devDependency` allows the user to run the application using Nodemon:
~~~
$ npm install nodemon --save-dev
~~~

## Usage

The application can be initiated by inserting `node server.js` into the command line interface and running the application on `localhost: 2187`.

An example of usage when testing the application using Nodemon as it updates the webpage after every change it detects:
~~~
$ npm run dev
~~~
